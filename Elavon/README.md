For 25 years, Elavon has helped more than one million customers around the world grow their business through payments. Our flexible, secure and innovative payment solutions help businesses attract and keep customers, develop partner relationships, process payments and simplify operations.

In the context of U.S. Bank hackathons, we will have access to the Elavon Converge API which is a secure, server-based system that supports transaction processing (authorization  and settlement) in real-time. The Converge API uses a pseudo-XML or key value pair implementation.

- More details can be found at: https://developer.elavon.com

The Converge API has two main versions:

- xml version: "processxml.do"
	This version requires the request data to be sent as an encapsulated XML data message as a query argument on the request string.
	The response message is an xml object.
	-- https://api.demo.convergepay.com/VirtualMerchantDemo/processxml.do


- standard version: "process.do"
	This version takes all of the required data as separate query string arguments. 
	The response message is an HTML page. For this reason, it may be more difficult to use this version as the specific values must be parsed out of the resulting HTML page.

# Postman artifacts
The included Postman files include samples of both Converge API calls. A separate environment file is also included.
